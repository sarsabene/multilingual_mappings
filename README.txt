Even if multilingual ontologies are now more common, for historical reasons, in the biomedical domain, many ontologies or terminologies have been translated from one natural language to another resulting in two potentially aligned ontologies but with their own specificity (e.g., format, developers, and versions). Most often, there is no formal representation of the translation links between translated ontologies and original ones and those mappings are not formally available as linked data. However, these mappings are very important for the interoperability and the integration of multilingual biomedical data. In this project, we propose an approach to represent translation mappings between ontologies based on the NCBO BioPortal format. We have reconciled more than 228K mappings between ten English ontologies hosted on NCBO BioPortal and their French translations. Then, we have stored both the translated ontologies and mappings on a French customized version of the platform, called the SIFR BioPortal, making the whole thing available in RDF.
